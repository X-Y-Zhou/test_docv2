Gillespie developed a stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) to simulate stochastic dynamics for such systems [1].  While this Markovian assumption considerably simplifies model analysis, it is dubious for modelling certain non-elementary reaction events that encapsulate multiple intermediate reaction steps [2]. To simulate such problems, several exact SSA methods for chemical reaction systems with delays (also known as delay SSA) were proposed [3-5].","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"DelaySSAToolkit.jl is a tool developed on top of JumpProcesses.jl which solves the stochastic simulation with delay and contains the following features:","category":"page"},{"location":"#Features","page":"Home","title":"Features","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#Features-2","page":"Home","title":"Features","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Various exact delay stochastic simulation algorithms are integrated;\nStochastic delay type is supported;\nMultiple delay channels and simultaneous delay reactions are supported;\nA cascade of delay reactions is supported (a delay reaction that causes other delay reactions);\nPriority queue and dependency graph are integrated for high computational performance;\nEcosystem with Catalyst, JumpProcesses, DifferentialEquations and more...","category":"page"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"DelaySSAToolkit can be installed through the Julia package manager:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"using Pkg\nPkg.add(\"DelaySSAToolkit\")","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"and you might need to run","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"using Pkg\nPkg.instantiate()","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"for the first time after installation.
